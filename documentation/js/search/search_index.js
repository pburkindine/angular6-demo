demonstrating my current patterns and understanding in the\nMEAN stack composed of Angular 6, Angular Material, Bootstrap 4, FontAwesome5, express,\nand MongoDB.\nBackend\nIn this application, an express REST API backed by MongoDB exposes a store\nselling sporks (it's a spoon and fork combined!).\nPassport and JWT are used for authentication against MongoDB and call authentication.\nTODO is JWT blacklisting and logout since Redis is not in the stack\nFrontend\nAn Angular Material front-end consumes the API.  The customer registers, builds a cart, then checks out using Stripe.\nIn the Angular app, we use @ngrx/store and ChangeDetectionStrategy.Push for performance, immutability and stability.\nngx-translate and ngx-config provide runtime configuration and translation.\nngx-logger feeds errors and events to an API endpoint where winston feeds them to the Elastic Beanstalk logs\nangulartics2 feeds data to Google Analytics.\nOutdatedBrowser is used to redirect users of old browsers.  Compodoc provides documentation.\nPipeline\nCode is deployed CI/CD using AWS CodePipline/CodeBuild.\nThe backend is deployed to an EC2 using Elastic Beanstalk, and the frontend\nis exposed in an S3 bucket.\nStrict linting of TypeScript, SCSS, JSON and HTML on the front-end\nand ES6 in the backend enforce quality measures at pre-commit and in the pipeline. no-any, max-file-line-count, and\nimmutability are enforced.\nUnit test coverage is around 98% lines.\nNOTE: There is no effort made at this time to implement a config.json builder,\nruntime config.json is committed to the repository\nNOTE: e2e tests are disabled because of issues getting ChromeDriver to run in CI\nInstructions for Use\n** Please note that this project uses yarn and that package-lock.json is in\nthe .gitignore **\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\nMIT License\nCopyright (c) 2018 Pete Burkindine\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
